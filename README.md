# Restaurant-Reservation-System_React-Vite.js_Java-SpringBoot_MySQL
This is a restaurant reservation system project built with Java Spring Boot for the backend and React with Vite.js for the frontend, using MySQL as the database. The system follows a layered architecture and supports multiple user roles, including Admin, Manager, Restaurant Owner, Customer, and a special Quota Manager who can increase reservation limits. Each user has access to a personalized dashboard interface built with React, offering a smooth and interactive experience. The backend handles all CRUD operations through RESTful APIs, while the MySQL database is designed with complex relational structures to support high volumes of data interaction. This full-stack system showcases seamless integration between a modern frontend and a robust backend, making it suitable for real-world restaurant reservation management needs.
